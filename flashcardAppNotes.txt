Flashcard App
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
npx prisma studio
npx prisma migrate reset

TODO-
- do you really need an identifier, and why isn't it showing after migration
- fix the decks seeding 

Features
- the user has decks and cards that they have authored
- users can COPY decks/cards made by other users, as long as they are public. The point is to allow users to make their own version of a deck, and then modify it as they see fit.
