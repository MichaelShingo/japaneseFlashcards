Any way to register 

Flashcard App
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
npx prisma studio
npx prisma migrate reset

TODO-
- do you really need an identifier, and why isn't it showing after migration
- fix the decks seeding 

Features
- the user has decks and cards that they have authored
- users can COPY decks/cards made by other users, as long as they are public. The point is to allow users to make their own version of a deck, and then modify it as they see fit.
- wanikani integration to show furigana or not

Routes
- create card
- read card: (all of your cards, all public cards, one public card, one of your cards)
- update card
- delete card
- CRUD deck
SRS
- update srs level 

User-to-user interactions
- Duplicate card and assign to current user
- duplicate deck and assign to current user
- cut and paste card to another deck
- copy and paste card to another deck
- more advanced srs algorithm, like integrating a timer for how long someone took to answer a flashcard 

- UI inspiration and disinspiration from Bunpro and Brainscape 
- want to try to integrate paid membership?
